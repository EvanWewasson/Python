#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y = "your" + "name"
x = "Evan" + "Wewasson"

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 + 4 
y = 5 + 1


#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
a = 5 - 2
b = 6 - 3



#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4.2 - 3.1
x = 5.5 - 2.7
#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 * 4
x = 3 * 3

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
c = "evan" * 3


#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 / 2
x = 6 / 3


#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4.4 / 2.2 
x = 3.3 / 1.1


#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 % 4
x = 5 % 4

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 5 // 4
x = 4 // 4

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 ** 4
x = 4 ** 2

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

x = "basket" / 4
