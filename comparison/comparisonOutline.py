This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.
'''

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
mat = 6
tam = 6
math = (tam == mat)
print(math)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x = 3
y = 3
z = (x == y)
print(z)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = 5
b = 4
c = (a > b)
print(c)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
e = 7
f = 9
g = (e < f)
print(g)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
h = 4
i = 4
j = (h >= i)
print(j)


#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
k = 5
l = 6
m = (k <= l)
print(m)


#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
take = 6
over = 4
takeover = (take < over)
print(takover)
