#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#integer

b = 2

#float

x = .5 

#string

e = "evan"

#boolean

t = True 

f = False 

#list

l = [1,2,3]

#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
vara = 5
varA = 10

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
n = 6

n=9
print(n)

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

k = 22
k = "string"

vark = k 
print(k)

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

q = ["red","blue","green"]
print(q[1])

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

string = "Evan"
print(string[0])

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(q)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

m == 69
